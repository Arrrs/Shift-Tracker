Also i dont understand where we have the full list of currencies. When we show this list to choose one we should have it to be the same list every time i think. But i saw that we have different list for financial records to create (just 6 variants). But changed primarry currency used good on form open so it's ok. Can you think of good way to handle it everywhere to be used from one plase? I think we have now table in db where we use that currencies (so this way is ok).
